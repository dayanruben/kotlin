## :plugins:kotlin-dataframe

This module, published as "compiler-plugin-all", holds the Kotlin 2.x Compiler plugin of DataFrame.

A [work-in-progress](https://github.com/Kotlin/dataframe/issues/704)
plugin for your Kotlin project that can generate on-the-fly column accessors for the compiler and IDE even without
having to provide data schemas!

Details of how to use this compiler plugin for your own project will follow, but there is a
[demo project](https://github.com/koperagen/df-plugin-demo) you can try already.
